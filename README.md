# IT-Asset-Management
I developed this in-house app as a means to keep track of all the charity's IT equipment from mobile phones to laptops to all-in-ones. Previously, there was no formal IT asset register which caused issues in tracking devices especially when staff or volunteers left the organisation. Having equipment monitored by a program dramtatically improved the efficiency of allocating devices and ensuring equipment was returned promptly by leavers.
